# Databases1-Assignment

In this Assignment I made a Database for a Taxi Business Firm which deals with its employees and customers. I wrote SELECT statements to get the information back from the ERD table I made. 

This Database takes in Employer Name, Address, ID, Email, Phone No., Pay, and Start Date. It also takes in the Customers Name, Address, ID, Email, and Phone No.

The SQL code block I wrote to changes the data in my system which simulates a transaction. A transaction is a
combination of inserting, updating and / or deleting rows.
